                        </div>

                                "Disaster risk reduction is the concept and practice of reducing disaster risks through
                                systematic efforts to analyze and reduce the causal factors of disasters."
                            </div>

                            <div>
                                Throughout the past few years, the international community has faced many disasters:
                                natural disasters brought on by climate change, the COVID pandemic, and more conflicts
                                that are results of human actions. The global society is susceptible to disruption at
                                any moment. Even though the pandemic and other disasters may be quietly fading away, it
                                is certain that the immense damage it has caused to global agendas such as the
                                Sustainable Development Goals and the Paris Agreement will remain for quite some time to
                                come. This further reinforced the necessity of resilience in the face of such disasters.
                            </div>

                            <div>
                                A Disaster Risk Reduction plan like the Sendai Framework provided tangible actions not
                                only to curb losses, but also to ensure our development for the future. It is imperative
                                that key actors such as strengthening disaster risk governance, building capacity,
                                establishing research institutions, sharing information, and providing policy advice
                                play a major role in preventing systematic risk and promoting resilience within society.
                                Our goal is to build resilience rather than passively react to unpredictable disasters
                                by establishing durable and sustainable frameworks in areas such as education,
                                humanitarian assistance and more.

                            weaponization</div>

                                Nuclear energy, though not renewable, is much more sustainable than other forms of
                                energy proliferation, such as the burning of fossil fuels. This is because a large
                                majority of the materials used in this proliferation are recyclable, with up to 96% of
                                it being reusable. This makes it a preferable alternative for LEDCs, as though the
                                plants are expensive to construct, they're relatively inexpensive to run. Therefore,
                                nuclear energy has high potential as the primary energy source for underdeveloped
                                countries.
                            </div>
                            <div>However, the harnessing of nuclear energy itself accompanies a much higher risk:
                                nuclear weaponization. There have been extensive international issues centered around
                                the ambiguous balance between nuclear energy development and nuke production, such as
                                the Iran Nuclear Act and the US's withdrawal from the pact. Now, many countries use
                                nuclear weapons to hold a strategic advantage and deterrence over other nations.
                            </div>
                            <div>The issue spans over virtually every country because member states are either concerned
                                about energy usage or weaponization.</div>

                                In a world of rising conflicts and political turmoil, the trafficking of illicit
                                weapons, often known as “arms trafficking,” are causes of mass destruction against
                                others, and have been of great concern to member states around the world. The question
                                is: How will these illicit weapons be detected, and if so, how can actions be taken to
                                ensure that they do not land in the wrong hands? Delegates should appropriately consider
                                the reasons behind why these illicit weapons are even able to land in the hands of
                                terrorists in the first place.
                            </div>
                            <div>Governmental entities, as well as other organizations, such as private arms dealers,
                                who have the funds and means to transport these illicit weapons, take great measures to
                                cover their actions against the possibility of rebuke by the global community.
                                Therefore, the issue at hand will be somewhat challenging in the realm of determining
                                what regulations and preventative measures will truly solve the issue at hand, given the
                                dominance of Western-made weapons in the arms trafficking scene but the common
                                prevalence of these weapons in areas of high terrorist activity, such as in areas of
                                Africa where governmental control is lacking. To summarize, combating illicit weapons is
                                a tricky topic, one where sneakiness is common and circumvention is key.</div>

                                Amid the crises that arose in the pandemic era, food insecurity amounted to one of the
                                most imperative issues to be addressed worldwide. The breakdown of the global supply
                                chain, significant diminution of agricultural production export in Ukraine, rising crude
                                oil prices, abnormal climate events, and increasingly prevalent civil unrest all
                                culminate in the uneven distribution of sustenance as well as unaffordable food prices,
                                which in turn leads to record high malnutrition and famine across continents.
                                Consequently, while the World Trade Organization held its 12th Ministerial Conference in
                                June 2022, high-level ministers of member states delivered two substantive outcomes
                                thereof: World Food Programme exemption from export restriction as well as the
                                Declaration on the Emergency Response to Food Insecurity, which purported to “ensure
                                that any emergence measures introduced to address food security concerns shall minimize
                                trade distortions as far as possible”. But were those sufficient? More and more member
                                states are calling for not only mere promises and emergency aid but also long-term
                                institutions for resolving future food insecurity issues. Thus, therein lies the core
                                question: Is there a way to build a long-term framework to maintain food security? And
                                if so, how?

                        </div>

                                The COVID-19 pandemic has had a significant impact on the global economy and
                                international trade, bringing unprecedented disruptions to people's lives. The pandemic
                                led to rising demand for medical goods trading, such as vaccines, face masks, and other
                                critical pandemic products. Despite the decline in global trade, the market for medical
                                goods registered an average growth rate of more than 14% from 2020 and 2021.
                            </div>
                            <div>However, there are also several issues relevant to the global trade of medical
                                supplies. For instance, insufficient supply of medical products has caused unequal
                                distribution and increased prices. Export restrictions were posed, delaying essential
                                transactions of critical medical products and further exacerbating supply insecurity. In
                                particular, driven by overwhelming demands and inadequate supply, the prices of face
                                masks were raised to an exorbitantly high level. Furthermore, the world is primarily
                                dependent on certain countries to provide critical pandemic products, resulting in
                                limited participation of underdeveloped countries and possible infringements by more
                                dominant countries upon their economy and politics. Thus, the unequal distribution of
                                medical goods aggravated the difficulties of the economy while also obstructing the
                                recovery of underdeveloped countries from the pandemic. The WTO has since urged
                                countries to roll back export restrictions and put trade-facilitating measures in place.

                                As globalization continues to fuel economic expansion in developed and developing
                                countries, the predominantly laissez-faire trading system led to the rise of certain
                                global industry mongrels that monopolize markets and depower small businesses of local
                                origins. Though most governments have innate protection mechanisms to avoid total
                                reliance on foreign businesses, the lack of sufficient regulations on international
                                trade organization and even profiting countries themselves has sustained a creeping of
                                neoimperialism in exploited countries.

                                With the 10th Sustainable Development Goals named "Reduced Inequalities," it's often
                                that campaigns focus on income and social recognition as the main targets of the issue.
                                Yet in view of these goals being "sustainable" for development, countries must also
                                allocate resources in ensuring equality to wage business to help people maintain their
                                own living. While this issue got some spotlight in chapter 3 of UNDP's 2021 Regional
                                Human Development Report for Latin America and the Caribbean, the phenomenon of foreign
                                monopoly persists in many other regions of the world. Aside from the common methods of
                                tariffs and per-unit taxation, there must also be efforts on promoting domestic
                                businesses to level the playing field in a market economy. Member states ought to devise
                                policies balanced between freedom of privatization and freedom to compete.

                                The outbreak of the Covid-19 pandemic has permanently increased poverty vulnerability
                                among households in developing countries, undoing a decade of UN efforts toward poverty
                                reduction. The notion of vulnerability includes efforts of households to cope with
                                fluctuations and shocks, as well as means to reduce risks of falling into poverty. These
                                idiosyncratic shocks ranging from health emergencies, social hardships, rising costs of
                                foodstuff and living needs require policy concern from national governments as well as
                                through the UNDP disaster risk reduction framework to enhance preparedness and
                                resilience. Members of poor households are more vulnerable to illness and financially
                                incapable of affording medical attention while others may suffer from job and income
                                loss and fail to support their families and communities. Countries such as Cambodia, El
                                Salvador, and South Africa have endured the socioeconomic disruptions caused by the
                                pandemic, meaning that safety nets, poverty alleviation programs, and financial
                                inclusion need to be strengthened to support poverty-stricken households to cope with
                                risks. Vulnerability and poverty is a multidimensional issue that considers health,
                                education, nutrition, and standard of living beyond just the measurement of income. By
                                assessing vulnerability through UNDP's multidimensional vulnerability indices (MVIs),
                                both the public and private sector can inform policy alternatives through a more
                                inclusive framework that addresses the impacts of health uncertainties, social strife
                                and poor infrastructure in tackling global poverty.

                                China and India's border dispute is renownedly agitated in Arunachal Pradesh amidst a
                                stretch of over 3,440 kilometers. A region to the northeast of India, Arunachal
                                Pradesh's state annexation in 1987 and Indian leaders' proceeding visits had long irked
                                China. Fatal conflicts involving sticks since June 2020 - eventually gunshots in
                                December 2022 - escalated the unrest despite how a 1996 agreement prohibited firearms in
                                the region. Although both sides disengaged, tension accumulated as they scrambled to
                                build infrastructure along the border.

                                This conflict holds implications in the environmental sphere. The Himalayan plateau's
                                monsoonal rains and seasonal ice-melts fed rivers to South, Southeast and East Asia;
                                however, toxic leaks from both nuclear powers' mines and agricultural developments loom
                                over the water source. Construction of roads and hospitals that induce deforestation can
                                also compromise the Himalayas' third-largest biodiversity hotspot. On the humanitarian
                                side, water supplies regulated by hydroelectric plants and dams threaten the livelihood
                                of up to 630 million people, with Tibetans and other minorities calling for autonomy
                                between the two parties' intensifying grip.

                            <div>Overall, dynamic politics complicate the environmental and humanitarian issues, with
                                both the Chinese and Indian government seeking allies that may result in further

                        </div>

                                The Insurgency in the Maghreb refers to the violent clash between governments in the
                                Maghreb-Sahel region in Africa and the Islamic militants that started since the Algerian
                                Civil War in 2002. Such violent groups include Al-Qaeda and the Islamic State (ISIL).
                            </div>

                            <div>
                                The fact that extremist beliefs continue to define and characterize the wave of
                                insurgencies that has plagued the Maghreb Sahel region for so long raises some troubling
                                considerations. After violent jihadists brought Algeria's insurgency in the 1990s into
                                infamy, people expect that dissident rebels would stop adopting extreme ideology since
                                it alienates the majority of local communities, fragments the ranks of rebels, and
                                scares away outside supporters. Seeing such risks, it is perplexing why Salafi jihadism
                                continues to be the insurgent repertoire in the Maghreb-Sahel region. What's more
                                puzzling is that this radical ideology has evolved into the ideal weapon of war and the
                                ideological hub that unites the support of various types of oppressed communities.
                                Salafi jihadism aided Sahel rebels to survive, recruit, and outcompete other contesting
                                armed players. As such, it is of great importance to the Security Council in resolving
                                the bloodshed and restoring peace and order to the region.
